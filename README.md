<br>
Kubero brings the convinience of Heroku to your kubernetes cluster. Your developers should not need to worry about the underlying infrastructure and deployment.
<br>
<br>
Kubero is Kubernetes native and runs on every Kubernetes. It cpmes with a UI, API and a CLI.
<br>
<br>

## What can Kubero do for you?
- Create a CI pipeline with up to 4 separate environments for all your applications: review apps -> testing -> stageing -> production
- Build, start and cleanup reviewapps after opening/closing a pull request
- Automatic deployment of the app based on a branch or tag
- Create scheduled tasks (cronjobs)
- Easy deployment of your apps on kubernetes without helm charts
- Deploy addons (PostgreSQL, Redis, more to come)
- Easy access of application logs in the UI
- Easy and safe restart of the application in the UI

## What Kubero won't do for you
- Manage your Kubernetes cluster
- Install and manage your operators
- Give access to your container CLI

## Supported GIT repositories
- Github
- Bitbucket
- Gilab (hosted and self hosted)
- Gitea (hosted and self hosted)
- Gogs (hosted and self hosted)

## Which languages are supported
Basicly *everything* that can be shipped in a single container. Kubero uses official images to build and run the apps. But they can be replaced or extended to fit your needs.

- GoLang (including Hugo, gin-gonic)
- Python (including Flask)
- JavaScript/NodeJS
