<br>
Kubero is a Internal Developer Platform (IDP) that brings the convenience of Heroku to your Kubernetes cluster. Your developers should not need to worry about the underlying infrastructure or deployment. It enables you to deploy your applications with a few clicks. It also provides a dashboard and CLI to manage your applications.
<br>
<br>
Kubero is Kubernetes native and runs on any Kubernetes instance.
<br>
<br>

## What can Kubero do for you?
- Create a CI pipeline with up to 4 separate environments for all your applications: review apps -> testing -> stageing -> production
- Build, start and cleanup review-apps after opening/closing a pull request
- Automatic deployment of the app based on a branch or tag
- Create scheduled tasks (cronjobs)
- Easy deployment of your apps on Kubernetes without helm charts
- Deploy addons (PostgreSQL, Redis, more to come)
- Easy access of application logs in the UI
- Easy and safe restart of the application in the UI

## What Kubero won't do for you
- Manage your Kubernetes cluster
- Install and manage your operators
- Give access to your container CLI

## Supported GIT repositories (hosted and self-hosted)
- Gitea
- Forgejo (WIP)
- Gogs
- Github
- Gitlab
- Bitbucket

## Tested languages/frameworks
Basicly *everything* that can be shipped in a single container. Kubero uses official images to build and run the apps. But they can be replaced or extended to fit your needs.

- GoLang (including Hugo, gin-gonic)
- Python (including Flask)
- JavaScript/NodeJS
- PHP (including Laravel)
- Ruby (including Rails)
- Static HTML
- Rust (including Rocket)
- ...
