<br>
Kubero is a fully self-hosted Internal Developer Platform (IDP) that brings the convenience of Heroku to your Kubernetes cluster. It enables you to deploy your applications with a few clicks on the Dashboard or by CLI. It has a built-in CI/CD pipeline and supports multiple staging environments.
<br>
<br>
Kubero is Kubernetes native and runs with two containers on any Kubernetes instance.

- Create scheduled tasks (cronjobs)
- Easy deployment of your apps on Kubernetes without helm charts
- Deploy addons (PostgreSQL, Redis, more to come)
- Easy access of application logs in the UI
- Easy and safe restart of the application in the UI

## What Kubero won't do for you
