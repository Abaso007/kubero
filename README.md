<br>
Kubero is a fully self-hosted Internal Developer Platform (IDP) that brings the workflows of Heroku to your Kubernetes cluster. It enables you to deploy your applications with a few clicks on the Dashboard or by CLI. It has a built-in CI/CD pipeline and supports multiple staging environments.
<br>
<br>
Kubero is Kubernetes native and runs with two containers on any Kubernetes instance.

## What can Kubero do for you?
- Create a CI pipeline with up to 4 separate staging environments for all your applications
- Build, start and cleanup review-apps after opening/closing a pull request
- Automatic deployment of the app based on a branch or tag
- Create scheduled tasks (cronjobs)
- Easy deployment of your apps on Kubernetes without helm charts
- Deploy add-ons for your application (PostgreSQL, Redis, more to come)
- Easy access of application logs in the UI
- Easy and safe restart of the application in the UI
- Periodic vulnerability scans of your running apps

## What Kubero won't do for you
- Manage your Kubernetes cluster
- Give access to your container CLI

## How it Works
1. Create a pipeline with the phases you need (dev, staging, production)
2. Connect the pipeline to your git repository (Github, Bitbucket, Gitlab, Gitea, Gogs)
3. Create your apps with cronjobs and addons

Kubero will then start an init container that will clone your repository and another init container to build your app. Kubero is now able to start the container and expose it to the internet. You can now access your app via the configured domain.

- JavaScript/NodeJS
- PHP (including Laravel)
- Ruby (including Rails)

- MySQL
- PostgreSQL
- Redis
- MongoDB
- Elasticsearch
- Kafka
- CouchDB
