<br>
Kubero brings the convinience of Heroku to your kubernetes cluster. Your developers should not need to worry about the underlying infrastructure and deployment. It enables you to deploy your applications within some clicks. It also provides a dashboard and CLI to manage your applications.
<br>
<br>
Kubero is Kubernetes native and runs on every Kubernetes.
<br>
<br>

## What can Kubero do for you?
- Create a CI pipeline with up to 4 separate environments for all your applications: review apps -> testing -> stageing -> production
- Build, start and cleanup reviewapps after opening/closing a pull request
- Automatic deployment of the app based on a branch or tag
- Create scheduled tasks (cronjobs)
- Easy deployment of your apps on kubernetes without helm charts
- Deploy addons (PostgreSQL, Redis, more to come)
- Easy access of application logs in the UI
- Easy and safe restart of the application in the UI

## What Kubero won't do for you
- Manage your Kubernetes cluster
- Install and manage your operators
- Give access to your container CLI

## Supported GIT repositories

- GoLang (including Hugo, gin-gonic)
- Python (including Flask)
- JavaScript/NodeJS
- PHP (including Laravel)
